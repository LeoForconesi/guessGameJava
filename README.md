<h1>The Game</h1>

<p>Guess game basically is a game where a player must guess a random number set by the computer by following leads that the machine will prompt to the player. These leads will tell if the number to guess is greater or lesser than the given by the player.</p>

<p>Also the game can be switched to machine vs player mode, where the user must enter a random number and the machine will try to guess it. The same leading rule applies for the machine, the player must provide if the number the computer has given, is grater or lesser than the number to guess.</p>

<p>In both cases, the game will end when the computer or the player guesses the number.</p>
